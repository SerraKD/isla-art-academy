## Wireframes

## Color Scheme

I decided to pick colors that are coherent to the hero image. I chose bright and intensive colors to maintain users' interest and create a minimalistic but visually pleasing website. The Contrast Grid is used to ensure the website is accessible.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Main Menu__

The Main menu is fixed on top of the page and has the Academy name as a header with a navigation bar. Navigation bar items have a hover effect on large screens.

Because the Academy name is long, I styled the main menu differently for small, medium, and large screens for compatibility.

| Screen Size | Image |
| :----: | :----: |
| Small Screen | ![Menu image small screens](docs-readme/heading-small.png) |
| Medium Screen | ![Menu image medium screens](docs-readme/heading-medium.png) |
| Large Screen | ![Menu image large screens](docs-readme/heading-large.png) |

- __Hero Section__

At first, the hero image I picked was one color simple watercolor paint, but then I decided it was not striking enough and changed to the current image. I tried to set the heading on the image to specifically not to come on top of white strikes in the painting.

The main goal of this section is to get the user's attention simply with the intriguing message and image.
