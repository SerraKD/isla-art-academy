The Isla Art Academy website is created to showcase academy's the identity and offer painting classes to interested individuals. The website is beneficial for users who want to learn more about the school, view the class schedule, and send an application form to join studies.

## Wireframes

At the planning stage I used Balsamiq wireframes to create the basic layout of the website.

| Section | Mobile View | Desktop View |
| ---- | :----: | :----: |
| Hero | ![Mobile hero wireframe image](docs-readme/hero-mobile.png) | ![Desktop hero wireframe image](docs-readme/hero-desktop.png) |
| About | ![Mobile about wireframe image](docs-readme/about-mobile.png) | ![Desktop about wireframe image](docs-readme/about-desktop.png) |
| Sign Up & Contact | ![Mobile signup and contact wireframe image](docs-readme/signup-mobile.png) | ![Desktop signup and contact wireframe image](docs-readme/signup-desktop.png)|

## Color Scheme

I decided to pick colors that are coherent to the hero image. I chose bright and intensive colors to maintain users' interest and create a minimalistic but visually pleasing website. The Contrast Grid is used to ensure the website is accessible.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Main Menu__

- The Main menu is fixed on top of the page and has the Academy name as a header with a navigation bar.

- Navigation bar items have a hover effect on large screens.

- Because the Academy name is long, I styled the main menu differently for small, medium, and large screens for compatibility.

| Screen Size | Image |
| :----: | :----: |
| Small Screen | ![Menu image small screens](docs-readme/heading-small.png) |
| Medium Screen | ![Menu image medium screens](docs-readme/heading-medium.png) |
| Large Screen | ![Menu image large screens](docs-readme/heading-large.png) |

- __Hero Section__

At first, the hero image I picked was one color simple watercolor paint, but then I decided it was not striking enough and changed to the current image. I tried to set the heading on the image to specifically not to come on top of white strikes in the painting.

- This section contains a heading and a background image of a colorful painting.

- The main goal of this section is to get the user's attention simply with the intriguing heading and image.

- __About Us Section__

This section contains straightforward information about the Academy's principles, target audience, and education methods. The main goal is to give significant information without losing the user's interest. 

- It encourages users to join the academy while giving them information on how to get in touch.

![About Us section image](docs-readme/aboutus-img.png)

- __Lesson Schedule Section__

- The initial design had the Lesson Schedule as part of the About Us section. Later I decided to split it into two different sections for a better layout. 

- This section contains details of the weekly lesson plan and the manner of using the classrooms.

![Lesson Schedule section image](docs-readme/schedule-img.png)

- __Sign Up Section__

- This section contains a signup form for users to easily join the academy. 
- The user has to fill out the form completely to be able to submit it.

![Sign Up section image](docs-readme/signup-img.png)

- __Footer__

- The footer contains the contact information and social media links. 

- I decided to put this information together so that users can use the social platforms as an option to contact the academy if they choose.

![Footer image](docs-readme/footer-img.png)

> Contact

- Contact information includes the Academy's address, phone number, and email.

> Socials

- Social media links are Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.

- When clicked on, it takes the user to the main page of the social media platform in a new tab. They have a hover effect on large screens for an interactive layout.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future, I would like to add a gallery page to the website that connects Isla Art Academy with Isla Art Gallery. There, users can view and purchase the paintings created by students of the academy and local artists.
