## Wireframes

At the planning stage I used Balsamiq wireframes to create the basic layout of the website.

| Section | Mobile View | Desktop View |
| ---- | :----: | :----: |
| Hero | ![Mobile hero wireframe image](docs-readme/hero-mobile.png) | ![Desktop hero wireframe image](docs-readme/hero-desktop.png) |
| About | ![Mobile about wireframe image](docs-readme/about-mobile.png) | ![Desktop about wireframe image](docs-readme/about-desktop.png) |
| Sign Up & Contact | ![Mobile signup and contact wireframe image](docs-readme/signup-mobile.png) | ![Desktop signup and contact wireframe image](docs-readme/signup-desktop.png)|

## Color Scheme

I decided to pick colors that are coherent to the hero image. I chose bright and intensive colors to maintain users' interest and create a minimalistic but visually pleasing website. The Contrast Grid is used to ensure the website is accessible.

![Contrast Grid colors](docs-readme/colorscheme.png)

## Features

The website consists of one page with five sections. My main goal was to 
create a website that is modest and useful. 

The contents are straight to the purpose while having pleasing visuals. 

### Existing Features

---

### __Main Menu__

The Main menu is fixed on top of the page and has the Academy name as a header with a navigation bar.

- Navigation bar items have a hover effect on large screens.

- Because the Academy name is long, I styled the main menu differently for small, medium, and large screens for compatibility.

| Screen Size | Image |
| :---- | :----: |
| Small Screen | ![Menu image small screens](docs-readme/heading-small.png) |
| Medium Screen | ![Menu image medium screens](docs-readme/heading-medium.png) |
| Large Screen | ![Menu image large screens](docs-readme/heading-large.png) |

### __Hero Section__

At first, the hero image I picked was one color simple watercolor paint, but then I decided it was not striking enough and changed to the current image. I tried to set the heading on the image to specifically not to come on top of white strikes in the painting.

- This section contains a heading and a background image of a colorful painting.

- The main goal of this section is to get the user's attention simply with the intriguing heading and image.

| Device | Image |
| :---- | :----: |
| Phone | ![Hero section phone image](docs-readme/responsive-hero-mobile.png) |
| Tablet | ![Hero section tablet image](docs-readme/hero-tablet.png) |
| Laptop | ![Hero section laptop image](docs-readme/herosection-img.png) |

### __About Us Section__

This section contains straightforward information about the Academy's principles, target audience, and education methods.

The main goal is to give significant information without losing the user's interest. 

- It encourages users to join the academy while giving them information on how to get in touch.

| Device | Image |
| :---- | :----: |
| Phone | ![About Us section phone image](docs-readme/responsive-about-mobile.png) |
| Tablet | ![About Us section tablet image](docs-readme/about-tablet.png) |
| Laptop | ![About Us section laptop image](docs-readme/aboutus-img.png) |

### __Lesson Schedule Section__

The initial design had the Lesson Schedule as part of the About Us section. Later I decided to split it into two different sections for a better layout. 

- This section contains details of the weekly lesson plan and the manner of using the classrooms.

| Device | Image |
| :---- | :----: |
| Phone | ![Lesson Schedule section phone image](docs-readme/responsive-schedule-mobile.png) |
| Tablet | ![Lesson Schedule section tablet image](docs-readme/schedule-tablet.png) |
| Laptop | ![Lesson Schedule section laptop image](docs-readme/schedule-img.png) |


### __Sign Up Section__

This section contains a signup form for users to easily join the academy.

- The user has to fill out the form completely to be able to submit it.

| Device | Image |
| :---- | :----: |
| Phone | ![Sign Up section phone image](docs-readme/responsive-signup-mobile.png) |
| Tablet | ![Sign Up section tablet image](docs-readme/signup-tablet.png) |
| Laptop | ![Sign Up section laptop image](docs-readme/signup-img.png) |

### __Footer__

The footer contains the contact information and social media links. 

- Can be reached easily by a user from the main menu _Contact_ link.

I decided to put this information together so that users can use the social platforms as an option to contact the academy if they choose.

| Device | Image |
| :---- | :----: |
| Phone | ![Footer  phone image](docs-readme/responsive-footer-mobile.png) |
| Tablet | ![Footer tablet image](docs-readme/footer-tablet.png) |
| Laptop | ![Footer  laptop image](docs-readme/footer-img.png) |

> __Contact__

- Contact information includes the Academy's address, phone number, and email.

> __Socials__

- Social media links are Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.

- When clicked on, it takes the user to the main page of the social media platform in a new tab. They have a hover effect on large screens for an interactive layout.

![Social media links hover image](docs-readme/social-hover.png)

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future, I would like to add a gallery page to the website that connects Isla Art Academy with Isla Art Gallery. There, users can view and purchase the paintings created by students of the academy and local artists.

## Testing

Throughout the development process, I tested the project regularly with  [Chrome Dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/).

- For each element and section, I experimented  with dev tools for a better layout and  responsiveness.

- Following the mobile-first rule, I designed elements and layout for the smallest screen and worked up to the big screen. I tested every change in this manner.

- I tried to record all changes made by this testing process with meaningful and detailed commit messages. Some examples are shown below.

| Commit | Commit Message | Fix reason |
| ---- | :----: | ---- |
| [3c00397](https://github.com/SerraKD/isla-art-academy/commit/3c00397d3cbeef84b0b07c700ce1df232715e571) | Change iimported font family to Lato and Montserrat | Poor user feedback for the first picked font family Lora & Libre Baskerville. |
| [8ded3ec](https://github.com/SerraKD/isla-art-academy/commit/8ded3ecba60660e1b8c9a7361be3aadc5554c3b6) | Make contact link work by changing footer id in index.html | During development, i realised that contact link on nav-bar is not working. |
| [175332f](https://github.com/SerraKD/isla-art-academy/commit/175332f312687f25a906376ba94775eff8fe4ee6) | Change logo to h1 heading and remove from list items | I wanted heading and nav-bar items to move separately for different screen sizes for better responsiveness. |
| [58d7b87](https://github.com/SerraKD/isla-art-academy/commit/58d7b8710b32287a6b4519dfe304cdf2de95b2a5)| Add padding to main heading to give breathing space | The main heading was too close to the top left corner of the page, creating a poor visual effect. |
| [2e7266b](https://github.com/SerraKD/isla-art-academy/commit/2e7266b2e90b16d3b9faee6e6c535e0680a49eed)| Add padding to hero heading to make it clear on smallest mobile device | Some letters of the white text for the heading were coming on top white stikes in the hero image.  I added extra padding and media query for medium-size devices to prevent this issue. | 

### __Manual Testing__

I tested manually all elements and pages on different size devices and browsers, and found no errors besides below ones.

- On dev tools, for mobile screens submit button text is black but when I go to the deployed page from my iPhone I find out that the text color for the submit button is white. I added a  black text color and font family Lato to the submit button styles to make sure this issue is fixed.

- Excessive padding for the signup section created a visually poor experience. I reduced the top and bottom padding for a better look on all devices and browsers.

I used 4 different browsers for manual testing and I didn't find issues.

- Chrome
- Safari
- Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

### __Validator Testing__

- [V3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [V3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used for validator testing.

| Page | [V3C HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) | Result |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| index.html | ![Index validation result image](docs-readme/index-validator.png) |  No error found |
| 404.html | ![404 page validation result image](docs-readme/404-validator.png) |  No error found |

| Page | [V3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) | Result |
| :----: | :----: |  :----: |
| style.css | ![Css validation result image](docs-readme/css-validator.png) | No error found |

### __Accesibility Testing__

- [Page Speed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) was used for accesibility testing.

- Pagespeed mobile has a lower performance score due to image size and format. I didn't add any changes because the quality and size of the image are crucial for the website structure.

| Device | [Page Speed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) | [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Mobile | ![ Page speed mobile result image](docs-readme/pagespeed-mobile.png) | ![ Lighthouse mobile result image](docs-readme/lighthouse-mobile.png) |
| Desktop | ![ Page speed desktop result image](docs-readme/pagespeed-desktop.png) | ![ Lighthouse mobile result image](docs-readme/lighthouse-desktop.png) |

### Unfixed Bugs

## Deployment

I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to develop this website.

I deployed the website on [GitHub](https://github.com/) with following steps;

1. Log in to Github and go to projects' repository.
2. Find the Settings on the top of the repository and click.
